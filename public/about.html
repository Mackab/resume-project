    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>I have always been a gamer, so no suprise that gaming is one of my hobbies, my favourite games include Leauge of Legends, Baldur's Gate 3 and the F1 games.
        But it really depends on what games recently have come out.<br>

        Next to gaming I am also a big rugby fan, having played myself in my younger years is what really ignited my passion for the sport. Nowadays I just really watch the sport.<br>

        One of my recent hobbies has become F1, I started watching during the lockdown and my interest for the sport only went up from there.
